This project is use for training of deep reinforcement learning, machine learning, related python libs. All demo and document has been written on Jupiter notebook.

## What has been included

## A pytorch pratical workshop

## Useful Numpy demos and skills for deep learning

## Matplotlib demos to copy

## Deep Reinforcement Learning Demo
There is an DRL demo to reimplement classic paper of DRL.
